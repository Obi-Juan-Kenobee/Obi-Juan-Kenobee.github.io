        <h3>Simple Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic including addition,
          subtraction, multiplication and division. This project is very simple
          in design and uses text and input selectors to select operations. Code
          is written to handle all of the arithmetic operations within the
          code.<br />

        <h3>Calculator Grid</h3>
        <p>
          A calculator using grid. Same concept as the previous calculator
          project, except using grid to layout the buttons. Also, instead of
          performing the operations in the code itself, it was handed over to
          JS's eval function. <br />

        <h3>Dice Rolling Game</h3>
        <p>
          A simple dice rolling game. The game is played with two players. The
          first die is assigned to player 1 and the second die is assigned to
          player 2. Whenever the 'roll' button is pressed the dice are rolled,
          and the player with the highest number wins. The h1 element is updated
          accordingly. Behind the scenes, the images of the dice are fetched and
          stored in an array. Random numbers are generated for both players and
          compared. After these numbers are obtained, they are used to retrieve
          the images from the array and update the DOM and display the
          winner.<br />

        <h3>Drum Kit</h3>
        <p>
          A drum kit that plays sounds. Whenever an image is tapped the
          corresponding sound is played for that drum. Buttons for each drumm
          are also 'animated' (restyled) using CSS to show that they are being
          pressed. After which an event is triggered and a switch statement used
          to play the corresponding sound and animate the corresponding drum
          button. <br />

        <h3>Simon Game</h3>
        <p>
          A game based on the Simon Game. The game works in the following
          manner: the user has to press the buttons in the correct order. If the
          user presses the wrong button, the game ends. At which point the
          screen 'flashes' red and the game is over. Everytime the user presses
          the right sequence, a new sequence is generated, displayed to the user
          as a level. A random number is generated which is then assigned to a
          color, then this color is added to the game pattern, and then
          displayed to the user. The corresponding sound is also played.<br />

        <h3>Forms & Validation</h3>
        <p>
          A simple form validation. The user must enter their name, email and
          comment. The name has a 3 char limit, email 8 and comment 10. The form
          fileds will highlight in red as long as the user does not type the
          correct format or enter the right amount of specified characters.
          <br />
          A form handler service is used to capture the form data. Demo Link -

        <h3>A FAQ accordion</h3>
        <p>
