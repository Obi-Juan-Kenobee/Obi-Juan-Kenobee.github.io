          operations.<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were created to store the value of user input.<br>
          <span>Data Types</span> - JS's ParseInt and ParseFloat functions were used to convert the user input into numbers.<br>
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - a simple if statement was used to determine if a user input was a number or not.<br>

        <h3>Simon Game</h3>
        <p>
          A game based on the Simon Game. JavaScript was used for the following class
          requirements:<br />
          <span>Functions</span> - several functions were created for this game, this is my most complex javascript project 
          so far. There are functions to play the sounds of each corresponding button, a function to start the game over,

          as well as a function to check the that user input (the pattern) matches the generated pattern.<br>
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were used to store counters, arrays for the generated pattern and the user's pressed pattern.
          <br>
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - used to check if the user input matches the generated pattern.<br>
          <span>DOM Manipulation</span> - used to animate buttons pressed, and to play sounds for the corresponding colored buttons.
          Change the h1 text, display when the game was over and to briefly change the background color to red to 
          indicate the wrong button was pressed and the game was over.<br>
          <span>Animations</span> - animations were used to animate the buttons pressed everytime a new sequence is generated.<br>
          <span style="color: greenyellow;">Bonus</span> - added regexp to check if the user was using a mobile device.
          The game know works well with taps on the screen, and text updates accordingly to let user know they can tap the screen.<br>
