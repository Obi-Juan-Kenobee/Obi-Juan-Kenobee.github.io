        <h3>Simple Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic including addition,
          subtraction, multiplication and division. This project is very simple
          in design and uses text and input selectors to select operations. Code
          is written to handle all of the arithmetic operations within the
          code.<br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Functions</span> - a function was created to handle all of the
          arithmetic operations.<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were created to store the value of
          user input.<br />
          <span>Data Types</span> - JS's ParseInt and ParseFloat functions were
          used to convert the user input into numbers.<br />
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - a simple if statement was
          used to determine if a user input was a number or not.<br />

        </p>

        <h3>Calculator Grid</h3>
        <p>
          A calculator using grid. Same concept as the previous calculator
          project, except using grid. Also, instead of performing the operations
          in the code itself, it was handed over to JS's eval function. <br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were created to store the value of
          user input and DOM elements.<br />
          <span>Data Types</span> - JS Eval function was used to run
          calculations and convert the user input into numbers.<br />
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - if statement was used to
          determine if a user had clicked the equal sign or clear button.<br />

        <h3>Dice Rolling Game</h3>
        <p>
          A simple dice rolling game. The game is played with two players. The
          first die is assigned to player 1 and the second die is assigned to
          player 2. Whenever the 'roll' button is pressed the dice are rolled,
          and the player with the highest number wins. The h1 element is updated
          accordingly. Behind the scenes, the images of the dice are fetched and
          stored in an array. Random numbers are generated for both players and
          compared. After these numbers are obtained, they are used to retrieve
          the images from the array and update the DOM.<br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were used to generate a random
          number from 1 to 6. Fetch and store a die image that displayed the
          face of the die corresponding to the random number.
          <br />
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - Used to check which of the
          two players had rolled the highest number.<br />
          <span>DOM Manipulation</span> - Used to change the image of the die to
          the face of the die corresponding to the random number. And to change
          the text of the winner.<br />

        <h3>Drum Kit</h3>
        <p>
          A drum kit that plays sounds. Whenever an image is tapped the
          corresponding sound is played for that drum. Buttons for each drumm
          are also 'animated' (restyled) using CSS to show that they are being
          pressed. After which an event is triggered and a switch statement used
          to play the corresponding sound and animate the corresponding drum
          button. <br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Functions</span> - functions were created to play the sound of
          each drum. And to animate the drum buttons.<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were used to store the sound of
          each drum. They were also used to add an even listener to each drum
          button through the DOM.
          <br />
          <span>Loops</span> - for loop used to add an event listener to each
          drum button and to play and animate the corresponding drum button.<br />
          <span>Event Listeners</span> - Event listeners were used to play the
          sound of each drum.<br />
          <span>Switch Statements</span> - switch statement was used to figure
          out which sound to play.<br />

        <h3>Simon Game</h3>
        <p>
          A game based on the Simon Game. The game works in the following
          manner: the user has to press the buttons in the correct order. If the
          user presses the wrong button, the game ends. At which point the
          screen 'flashes' red and the game is over. Everytime the user presses
          the right sequence, a new sequence is generated, displayed to the user
          as a level.<br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Functions</span> - several functions were created for this game,
          this is my most complex javascript project so far. There are functions
          to play the sounds of each corresponding button, a function to start
          the game over, a function to find the next sequence, a function to
          animate the buttons as they are pressed, as well as a function to
          check the that user input (the pattern) matches the generated
          pattern.<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - variables were used to store counters, arrays
          for the generated pattern and the user's pressed pattern.
          <br />
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - used to check if the user
          input matches the generated pattern.<br />
          <span>DOM Manipulation</span> - used to animate buttons pressed, and
          to play sounds for the corresponding colored buttons. Change the h1
          text, display when the game was over and to briefly change the
          background color to red to indicate the wrong button was pressed and
          the game was over.<br />
          <span>Animations</span> - animations were used to animate the buttons
          pressed everytime a new sequence is generated.<br />
          <span style="color: greenyellow">Bonus</span> - added regexp to check
          if the user was using a mobile device. The game know works well with
          taps on the screen, and text updates accordingly to let user know they
          can tap the screen.<br />

        <h3>Forms & Validation</h3>
        <p>
          A simple form validation. The user must enter their name, email and
          comment. The name has a 3 char limit, email 8 and comment 10. <br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Validation</span> - used client side validation to check whether
          the length of input for the name, email and comment is less than their
          specified limit. It is initially red using CSS :invalid and will turn
          green when it is valid. The email was also validated using regex.<br />

        <h3>A FAQ accordion</h3>
        <p>
          A FAQ accordion, this is a challenge taken from Frontend Mentor. The
          user must click on the accordion to expand and collapse it.
          <br />
          JavaScript was used for the following class requirements:<br />
          <span>Variables</span> - used to store the DOM elements.<br />
          <span>Comparison and Conditionals</span> - used to expand and collapse
          the accordion when clicked.<br />
