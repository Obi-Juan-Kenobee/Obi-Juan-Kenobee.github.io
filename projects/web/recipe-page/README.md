## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS NO FRAMEWORKS

### What I learned

I learned how to center divs and elements on a the page more effectively.
I learned the power of margin: 0 auto.


```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
      main {
        max-width: 900px;
        height: 100%;
        margin: 50px auto;
        padding: 50px;
        border-radius: 20px;
      }

      img {
        max-width: 850px;
        border-radius: 50px;
        padding: 24px;
      }
  }
```

### Continued development

I want to keep working on centering divs and elements on the page more effectively.
